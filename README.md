# Statistics-Multivariate-Methods

## Introduction:
This repository consistd of two files Serial Killer analysis and Multivariate analysis. These projects are completed by me for the academic purposes.
The projects mainly contain the statistical inferences about the analysis of the data. R is used to develop the coding for the projects.

## Contents:
[Serial Killer Analysis:](https://github.com/VeeraMummidi/Statistics-Multivariate-Methods/blob/main/Serial_killer%20Analysis.pdf) 
The analysis was based on a sample of serial killers from the Radford/FGCU serial killer database. This is a short report on the data analysis on serial killer data.

#### Reasearch questions:

1) Does the average age at first murder differ between killers with different motives?
2) Do Killers motivated by anger start at a younger age than those motivated by financial gain, on average?
3) Do they start at a different age to the general population of the serial killers?

Tools used : R script

[Multivariate Analysis:](https://github.com/VeeraMummidi/Statistics-Multivariate-Methods/blob/main/Multivariate_Analysis.pdf)
The data that is collected are various economic , Health and Environmental indicators of various countries which are highly correlated features to separate the countries into various groups according to income or Geographic. The data was analysed using multivariate methods. Dependencies are exploited between the features and Principal component analysis was perfomed and results are interpreted accordingly.

### Research Questions:
1) Any dependency between the variables exist?
2) How can the data redundancy be handled?
3) The maximum correlation between the sets of variables?
4) Which of the indicators are responsible for the maximum correlation?
5) Which groups of countries are separable clearly?

Tools used : R script , Rmarkdown.
